Main memory, also known as primary memory, is a key component in a computer system. It serves as the workspace where the CPU temporarily stores data and instructions for quick access. The organization of main memory involves its structure, addressing methods, and hierarchy to optimize performance.

---

### **1. Structure of Main Memory**
Main memory is typically organized as an array of memory cells. Each cell can store a fixed number of bits, commonly 8 bits (1 byte).

#### **Components:**
1. **Memory Cells**: Small storage units that hold binary data (0s and 1s).
2. **Address Lines**: Specify the location of a particular memory cell.
3. **Data Lines**: Transfer the actual data between memory and CPU.
4. **Control Lines**: Indicate operations like read or write.

---

### **2. Address Space**
The addressable range of main memory depends on:
1. **Word Size**: The number of bits stored in each memory location.
2. **Address Lines**: The total number of addressable locations is \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of address lines.

---

### **3. Memory Hierarchy**
Memory is organized hierarchically to balance speed, cost, and size:
1. **Registers** (fastest, smallest, most expensive).
2. **Cache Memory** (smaller, faster than main memory).
3. **Main Memory** (moderate speed and cost).
4. **Secondary Storage** (slow but large and cheap).

---

### **4. Types of Main Memory**
1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
   - Volatile memory used for temporary storage.
   - Types:
     - DRAM (Dynamic RAM): Requires refreshing.
     - SRAM (Static RAM): Faster but expensive.
2. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
   - Non-volatile memory used for permanent storage of firmware.

---

### **5. Memory Operations**
1. **Read Operation**:
   - CPU sends the address via address bus.
   - Memory retrieves the data and sends it to the CPU via the data bus.
2. **Write Operation**:
   - CPU sends the address and data to memory.
   - Data is written to the specified location.

---

### **6. Memory Interleaving**
**Definition**: Divides memory into modules to allow simultaneous access to improve speed.  
- **Example**: If 4 modules exist, addresses are distributed cyclically:  
  - Module 0: Address 0, 4, 8...  
  - Module 1: Address 1, 5, 9...

---

### **7. Addressing Methods**
1. **Byte-Addressable**:
   - Each byte has a unique address.
2. **Word-Addressable**:
   - Each word (multiple bytes) has a unique address.
