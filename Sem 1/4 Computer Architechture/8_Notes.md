## **8.1 Introduction**
- The CPU is responsible for interpreting and executing instructions from memory.
- It consists of:
  1. **Control Unit (CU)**: Directs operations of the CPU.
  2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
  3. **Registers**: Temporary storage locations within the CPU.

## **8.2 General Register Organization**

### **Register Overview**:
- Registers store intermediate data and instructions during execution.
- Types of registers:
  - **Accumulator (AC)**: Stores intermediate arithmetic and logic results.
  - **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
  - **Instruction Register (IR)**: Stores the current instruction being executed.
  - **Memory Address Register (MAR)**: Points to the memory address for reading/writing.
  - **Memory Data Register (MDR)**: Stores data read from or written to memory.

### **Register Organization**:
- General-purpose register sets are used for efficient execution.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster data access compared to memory.
  - Minimizes memory traffic.

### **Register Selection**:
- **Multiplexers (MUX)**: Used for selecting one of many registers during operations.
- **Decoders**: Enable data transfer to/from a specific register.

## **8.3 Stack Organization**

### **Definition**:
- A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure used for temporary storage.
- It is crucial for function calls, recursion, and interrupt handling.

### **Types of Stacks**:
1. **Register Stack**:
   - A set of registers that operate as a stack.
   - Limited size and very fast.
   
2. **Memory Stack**:
   - Implemented using a portion of main memory.
   - Larger capacity but slower than a register stack.

### **Stack Operations**:
1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of the stack.

### **Stack Pointer (SP)**:
- Points to the top of the stack.
- Automatically adjusted during push/pop operations.

## **8.4 Instruction Formats**

### **Definition**:
Instruction format refers to the structure of a machine instruction, including:
1. **Opcode**: Specifies the operation.
2. **Operands**: Specifies the data or memory addresses involved in the operation.

### **Instruction Length**:
- Shorter instructions execute faster but limit functionality.
- Longer instructions provide more flexibility but take longer to fetch and execute.

### **Common Formats**:
1. **Three-Address Instructions**:
   - Example: `ADD R1, R2, R3` (R1 = R2 + R3).
   - Requires more bits but fewer instructions.

2. **Two-Address Instructions**:
   - Example: `ADD R1, R2` (R1 = R1 + R2).
   - Saves space by overwriting one operand.

3. **One-Address Instructions**:
   - Example: `ADD X` (AC = AC + X).
   - Implicitly uses the accumulator for one operand.

4. **Zero-Address Instructions**:
   - Example: Used in stack-based architectures.
   - Operations implicitly involve the stack top.

## **8.5 Addressing Modes**

### **Definition**:
Addressing modes determine how operands are accessed in an instruction.

### **Types of Addressing Modes**:
1. **Immediate**:
   - Operand is specified directly in the instruction.
   - Example: `LOAD #5` (Load the constant 5).

2. **Direct**:
   - Address field points directly to the operand in memory.
   - Example: `LOAD 100` (Load value from memory location 100).

3. **Indirect**:
   - Address field points to a memory location containing the operand's address.
   - Example: `LOAD @200`.

4. **Register**:
   - Operand is located in a register.
   - Example: `LOAD R1`.

5. **Indexed**:
   - Combines a base address with an index register.
   - Example: `LOAD 100(X)` (Effective Address = 100 + value of X).

6. **Relative**:
   - Address calculated relative to the current value of the program counter.
   - Example: Used in branch instructions like `BUN +5`.

## **8.6 Data Transfer and Manipulation**

### **Categories of Instructions**:
1. **Data Transfer**:
   - Move data between registers, memory, and I/O.
   - Examples: `LOAD`, `STORE`, `MOVE`.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Perform arithmetic and logic operations.
   - Examples: `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `SHIFT`.

3. **Control Transfer**:
   - Alter the sequence of execution.
   - Examples: `JUMP`, `CALL`, `RETURN`.

## **8.7 Program Control**

### **Control Flow Instructions**:
1. **Conditional Branch**:
   - Branches based on a condition.
   - Example: `BUN` (Branch Unconditionally), `BNE` (Branch if Not Equal).

2. **Subroutine Call**:
   - Transfers control to a subroutine and returns to the caller after execution.
   - Involves `CALL` and `RETURN` instructions.

3. **Interrupt Handling**:
   - Handles asynchronous events like I/O or hardware signals.
   - Uses the interrupt vector to locate service routines.

## **8.8 Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)**

### **Characteristics**:
- Simplified instruction set for faster execution.
- Few instruction formats and addressing modes.
- Operations are performed in a single clock cycle.
- Relies heavily on compiler optimization.

### **Advantages**:
- Faster execution.
- Easier pipelining.

## **8.9 Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)**

### **Characteristics**:
- Large and complex instruction set.
- Supports multi-clock cycle instructions.
- Emphasizes hardware over software optimization.

### **Advantages**:
- Rich instruction set reduces the need for programming effort.
- Effective for complex operations.

## **8.10 Pipelining**

### **Definition**:
- A technique for executing multiple instructions simultaneously by dividing the execution process into stages.

### **Stages of Pipeline**:
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve instruction from memory.
2. **Decode**: Interpret the instruction.
3. **Execute**: Perform the operation.
4. **Write Back**: Save results.

### **Advantages**:
- Increases instruction throughput.
- Efficient resource utilization.

### **Challenges**:
- **Hazards**:
  - Structural Hazards: Resource conflicts.
  - Data Hazards: Dependencies between instructions.
  - Control Hazards: Branching-related delays.
