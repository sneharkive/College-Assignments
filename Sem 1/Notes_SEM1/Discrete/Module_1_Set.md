20. Define the cartesian product of two sets and give an example.

21. If the relation R is defined on the set of real numbers by the rule a R b hold if |a-b| <= 1/2 then prove that R is not equivalence relation.

22. If A, B, C are sets, proved algebraically that A * (B intersection  C) = (A * B) intersection (A * C)

23. Define a relation on a set and give an example.

24. If R is the relation from A = {1,2,3,4} to B = {2,3,4,5}, find the elements R defined by a R b, If a and b are both odd. Write also the domain and range of R.

25. Give an example of a relation that is both symmetric and anti-symmetric.

26. In that se S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,..........,15} the relation R is defined by 2*x + 3*y = 30 where x, y belongs to S. Find whether R is transitive, reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric.
