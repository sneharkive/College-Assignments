### 1. Comparison between Linked List and Linear Array

| Feature            | Linked List                                   | Linear Array                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Size**           | Dynamic (can grow or shrink)                  | Fixed (requires predefined size)                  |
| **Memory Usage**   | Uses extra memory for pointers                | Contiguous memory allocation                      |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | Efficient (especially at the beginning/middle) | Inefficient (involves shifting elements)          |
| **Access Time**    | Linear (O(n) as traversal is needed)          | Constant (O(1) for indexed access)                |
| **Preferred Use**  | When size is dynamic or frequent insertions/deletions are required | When random access is needed, or the size is fixed |

**Preference**: Use a linked list when memory allocation needs flexibility, or when insertion and deletion operations are frequent. Use an array for quick access to elements, especially when the size is known and doesn’t change.

### 2. Why a Doubly Linked List is More Useful than a Singly Linked List

A doubly linked list allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward) due to two pointers (next and prev) in each node, making it more efficient for tasks where reverse traversal or bidirectional iteration is needed. For example:
- Simplifies operations like deletion without needing a previous pointer in singly linked lists.
- Better suited for applications requiring forward and backward movement, like in navigation or undo/redo functionality.

### 3. Advantages and Uses of a Circular Linked List

#### Advantages
- Efficient looping through nodes without returning to the start.
- All nodes are treated equally, as each node has both a predecessor and successor.
- Can handle ongoing processes efficiently, especially in repetitive cycles.

#### Uses
- **Round-robin scheduling**: In operating systems, circular lists handle tasks cyclically.
- **Data structures like queues**: Circular linked lists are efficient for implementing queues or circular buffers.
- **Continuous data processing**: Useful for applications that require constant cycling through data, like playlists or game boards.

### 4. Use of a Header Node in a Header Linked List

A header node, placed at the start of a linked list, does not store actual data. Its main purposes include:
- Simplifying edge cases (like an empty list or insertion/deletion at the beginning).
- Acting as a reference point for efficient access to the start and sometimes the end of the list.

### 5. Linked Representation of the Polynomial \(7x^3y^2 - 8x^2y + 3xy + 100x - 4\)

To represent this polynomial using a linked list, each node should contain:
- **Coefficient**: The numerical coefficient of the term (e.g., 7, -8, 3, etc.).
- **Exponents**: Each term’s power of \(x\) and \(y\) (e.g., for \(7x^3y^2\), it would be 3 for \(x\) and 2 for \(y\)).
- **Next pointer**: Points to the next term in the polynomial.

A representation of the linked list would look like this:

| Coefficient | \(x\)-Exponent | \(y\)-Exponent | Next |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| 7           | 3               | 2              | ----> |
| -8          | 2               | 1              | ----> |
| 3           | 1               | 1              | ----> |
| 100         | 1               | 0              | ----> |
| -4          | 0               | 0              | NULL |

This structure lets you traverse the list and compute the polynomial efficiently.


Here’s the explanation and solutions for each question:

### 6. Difference between Circular Linked List and Singly Linked List

| Feature                    | Circular Linked List                                   | Singly Linked List                                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Last Node**              | Points to the first node, forming a cycle              | Points to `NULL`, indicating the end of the list     |
| **Traversal**              | Can start from any node and loop continuously          | Can only traverse in one direction, from head to end |
| **Use Cases**              | Useful for applications with cyclic processes (e.g., round-robin scheduling) | Used for linear, sequential storage and traversal    |

A circular linked list offers continuous traversal, making it ideal for scenarios requiring cyclic behavior, whereas a singly linked list is better suited for one-way data structures.

### 7. Form a Linked List to Store Students' Details

To represent each student’s details, we can create a structure (`struct`) with the following fields:
1. Roll Number
2. Name
3. Age
4. Next (pointer to the next student node)

Here’s a basic structure definition in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define the structure for the student node
struct Student {
    int rollNumber;
    char name[50];
    int age;
    struct Student *next;
};

// Function to create a new student node
struct Student* createStudent(int rollNumber, const char *name, int age) {
    struct Student *newStudent = (struct Student*)malloc(sizeof(struct Student));
    newStudent->rollNumber = rollNumber;
    strcpy(newStudent->name, name);
    newStudent->age = age;
    newStudent->next = NULL;
    return newStudent;
}
```

With this setup, we can create and add students to the list.

---

### 8. Insert the Record of a New Student in the List

To insert a new student into the list, we’ll add a function that links a new `Student` node to the end of the list.

```c
// Function to insert a new student at the end of the list
void insertStudent(struct Student **head, int rollNumber, const char *name, int age) {
    struct Student *newStudent = createStudent(rollNumber, name, age);
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = newStudent;
        return;
    }

    struct Student *temp = *head;
    while (temp->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = newStudent;
}
```

This function takes the head pointer, creating a new student node and appending it at the end of the list.

---

### 9. Delete the Record of a Student with a Specific Roll Number

To delete a student by roll number, we need a function that searches for the node, updates pointers, and frees the memory.

```c
// Function to delete a student by roll number
void deleteStudent(struct Student **head, int rollNumber) {
    struct Student *temp = *head;
    struct Student *prev = NULL;

    // If the head node itself holds the roll number
    if (temp != NULL && temp->rollNumber == rollNumber) {
        *head = temp->next;
        free(temp);
        printf("Student with roll number %d deleted.\n", rollNumber);
        return;
    }

    // Search for the student with the given roll number
    while (temp != NULL && temp->rollNumber != rollNumber) {
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    // If student not found
    if (temp == NULL) {
        printf("Student with roll number %d not found.\n", rollNumber);
        return;
    }

    // Unlink the node from the linked list and free memory
    prev->next = temp->next;
    free(temp);
    printf("Student with roll number %d deleted.\n", rollNumber);
}
```

This function takes the head pointer and the roll number, removes the node with the specified roll number, and ensures memory cleanup.
