### **Q10: Why is dynamic memory allocation essential for linked lists?**  
- **Flexibility**: Allows nodes to be added or removed at runtime.  
- **Efficient Memory Use**: Allocates only the required memory for each node.  
- **No Fixed Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically.

### **Q9: List some applications of linked lists.**  
1. **Dynamic Data Storage**: Useful for scenarios where data size changes frequently.  
2. **Implementation of Stacks and Queues**.  
3. **Graphs**: Adjacency lists for representing graphs.  
4. **Memory Management**: Managing free memory blocks using linked lists.  
5. **Hashing**: Chaining for collision resolution.
