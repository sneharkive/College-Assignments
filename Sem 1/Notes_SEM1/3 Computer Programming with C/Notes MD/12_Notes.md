# **Chapter 12: File Management in C**

## **12.1 Introduction to File Handling**
File handling in C allows you to read from and write to files on disk. This enables permanent storage of data, which persists even after the program ends, unlike data stored in variables, which are lost once the program terminates.

- **File Operations** in C include opening a file, reading from it, writing to it, and closing it.
- C provides a set of functions to handle files in a convenient manner.

---

## **12.2 Types of Files**
There are two primary types of files:
1. **Text Files**: Contain data in a human-readable form (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`).
2. **Binary Files**: Store data in binary format, making them more efficient for certain operations but harder for humans to read (e.g., `.dat`).

## **12.3 File Pointers**
A **file pointer** is a pointer variable used to keep track of the current position in the file. It is used by various file operations to determine where to read from or write to.

- File pointers are of type `FILE*`, defined in `stdio.h`.
- A **file pointer** is associated with a specific file opened in the program.

---

## **12.4 File Handling Functions in C**
C provides several functions for file operations. The general syntax for using file functions involves creating a `FILE` pointer to interact with the file.

### **Opening a File**
To perform any file operation, you must first **open** the file using the `fopen()` function.

### **Syntax**:
```c
FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
```

- **`filename`**: The name of the file to open.
- **`mode`**: Specifies the file operation mode (read, write, append, etc.).

### **Common File Modes**:
- `"r"`: Read mode (file must exist).
- `"w"`: Write mode (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
- `"a"`: Append mode (creates a new file or appends to an existing file).
- `"r+"`: Read and write mode (file must exist).
- `"w+"`: Write and read mode (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
- `"a+"`: Append and read mode (creates a new file or appends to an existing file).
- `"b"`: Binary mode (added to read/write modes for binary files, e.g., `"rb"`, `"wb"`).

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL) {
    printf("File not found.\n");
} else {
    printf("File opened successfully.\n");
}
```

- If the file cannot be opened (e.g., if the file doesnâ€™t exist), `fopen()` returns `NULL`.

---

### **Closing a File**
After you finish performing operations on a file, always **close** it using the `fclose()` function.

### **Syntax**:
```c
int fclose(FILE *file);
```

- Closes the file and releases any resources associated with it.

### **Example**:
```c
fclose(file);
```

---

## **12.5 Reading from a File**
C provides several functions for reading data from a file.

### **fgetc()**: Read a single character from a file.
- **Syntax**: `int fgetc(FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: The next character in the file as an integer, or `EOF` if the end of the file is reached.

### **Example**:
```c
char ch;
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {
        printf("%c", ch);
    }
    fclose(file);
}
```

### **fgets()**: Read a string (line) from a file.
- **Syntax**: `char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: The string read from the file. Stops when `n-1` characters are read or a newline or EOF is encountered.

### **Example**:
```c
char line[100];
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {
        printf("%s", line);
    }
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

### **fread()**: Read binary data from a file.
- **Syntax**: `size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *file);`
- **Parameters**:
  - **`ptr`**: Pointer to a block of memory where the read data will be stored.
  - **`size`**: Size of each element to be read.
  - **`count`**: Number of elements to read.
  - **`file`**: Pointer to the file to read from.
- **Returns**: The number of items successfully read.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("data.dat", "rb");
int data[10];
if (file != NULL) {
    fread(data, sizeof(int), 10, file);  // Reads 10 integers from the file
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

## **12.6 Writing to a File**
To write data to a file, use the following functions:

### **fputc()**: Write a single character to a file.
- **Syntax**: `int fputc(int char, FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: The character written, or `EOF` if an error occurs.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
if (file != NULL) {
    fputc('A', file);  // Writes 'A' to the file
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

### **fputs()**: Write a string (line) to a file.
- **Syntax**: `int fputs(const char *str, FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: A non-negative integer if successful, or `EOF` if an error occurs.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
if (file != NULL) {
    fputs("Hello, World!\n", file);  // Writes the string to the file
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

### **fwrite()**: Write binary data to a file.
- **Syntax**: `size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *file);`
- **Parameters**:
  - **`ptr`**: Pointer to the data to be written.
  - **`size`**: Size of each element to write.
  - **`count`**: Number of elements to write.
  - **`file`**: Pointer to the file to write to.
- **Returns**: The number of elements successfully written.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("data.dat", "wb");
int data[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
if (file != NULL) {
    fwrite(data, sizeof(int), 5, file);  // Writes 5 integers to the file
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

## **12.7 File Positioning**
C allows you to move the file pointer to a specific location in the file. This is useful when you need to read or write data at certain positions in the file.

### **fseek()**: Move the file pointer to a specific location.
- **Syntax**: `int fseek(FILE *file, long offset, int whence);`
- **Parameters**:
  - **`file`**: Pointer to the file.
  - **`offset`**: The number of bytes to move.
  - **`whence`**: The reference point for the offset. Can be:
    - `SEEK_SET`: Beginning of the file.
    - `SEEK_CUR`: Current position.
    - `SEEK_END`: End of the file.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    fseek(file, 5, SEEK_SET);  // Moves the pointer 5 bytes from the beginning
    char ch = fgetc(file);     // Reads from the new position
    printf("%c", ch);
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

### **ftell()**: Get the current position of the file pointer.
- **Syntax**: `long ftell(FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: The current position of the file pointer, or `-1L` if an error occurs.

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END);
    long size = ftell(file);  // Returns the size of the file
    printf("File size: %ld bytes", size);
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

## **12.8 Error Handling in File Operations**
File operations may fail due to various reasons (e.g., file not found, permission denied). C provides the `ferror()` function to check for errors and `clearerr()` to clear error flags.

### **ferror()

**: Check for errors in a file operation.
- **Syntax**: `int ferror(FILE *file);`
- **Returns**: A non-zero value if an error occurred, `0` otherwise.

### **clearerr()**: Clear error and EOF flags.
- **Syntax**: `void clearerr(FILE *file);`

### **Example**:
```c
FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
if (file != NULL) {
    // Perform some operations...
    if (ferror(file)) {
        printf("Error occurred while reading the file.\n");
    }
    fclose(file);
}
```

---

## **12.9 Summary**
- **File handling** in C allows reading and writing data to files.
- The functions `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fgetc()`, `fputs()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`, and others are used for file operations.
- File pointers track the current position in the file.
- Text and binary files can be managed with different file modes.
- Use `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `ferror()`, and `clearerr()` for file positioning and error handling.
