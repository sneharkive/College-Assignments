# **Chapter 8: Character Arrays and Strings**

## **8.1 Introduction**
- In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters.
- A **string** is a sequence of characters, including the null character `\0` which marks the end of the string.
- Strings are stored in character arrays, and understanding how they work is fundamental in C programming.

---

## **8.2 Character Arrays**
- A **character array** is an array of data type `char`, used to store a sequence of characters.
- Each element in a character array holds a single character.
- Character arrays are often used to store strings in C.

### **Declaration and Initialization**
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  char array_name[size];
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```c
  char name[10];  // Declares a character array of size 10
  ```
- **Initialization**:
  - A character array can be initialized with individual characters or with a string literal.
  - Strings in C are terminated with a null character `'\0'` to indicate the end.

#### **Static Initialization**
```c
char name[5] = {'J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '\0'};
```
This is a manual initialization where the last element is explicitly set to `\0`.

#### **String Initialization**
```c
char name[] = "John";  // Implicitly adds the '\0' at the end
```

In the second example, the size of the array is automatically determined, and the null character is added at the end of the string.

## **8.3 Strings in C**
- In C, strings are stored as arrays of characters, with the last character being the null character (`'\0'`), which marks the end of the string.
- **String literals** are written inside double quotes.
  - Example: `"Hello"`
  
### **Memory Representation of Strings**
- A string like `"Hello"` is stored as an array of characters:
  ```c
  char str[] = "Hello";  // Internally: {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'}
  ```
- The null character (`'\0'`) is automatically added to the end of the string by the compiler.

---

## **8.4 String Operations**

### **8.4.1 String Length**
- The **length** of a string is the number of characters before the null terminator (`\0`).
- The standard library function `strlen()` is used to calculate the length of a string.
  
**Syntax**:
```c
int strlen(const char *str);
```

**Example**:
```c
char str[] = "Hello";
int len = strlen(str);  // len = 5
```

### **8.4.2 Copying Strings**
- **`strcpy()`** is used to copy the contents of one string to another.

**Syntax**:
```c
char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);
```

**Example**:
```c
char src[] = "World";
char dest[10];
strcpy(dest, src);  // Copies "World" into dest
```

### **8.4.3 Concatenating Strings**
- **`strcat()`** is used to append one string to the end of another string.

**Syntax**:
```c
char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);
```

**Example**:
```c
char str1[20] = "Hello ";
char str2[] = "World";
strcat(str1, str2);  // Concatenates "World" to "Hello "
printf("%s", str1);  // Output: "Hello World"
```

### **8.4.4 Comparing Strings**
- **`strcmp()`** compares two strings lexicographically.

**Syntax**:
```c
int strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2);
```
- Returns `0` if the strings are equal, a positive value if `str1` is greater, and a negative value if `str1` is smaller than `str2`.

**Example**:
```c
char str1[] = "apple";
char str2[] = "banana";
int result = strcmp(str1, str2);  // result < 0 because "apple" < "banana"
```

### **8.4.5 Finding a Character in a String**
- **`strchr()`** is used to locate the first occurrence of a character in a string.

**Syntax**:
```c
char *strchr(const char *str, int ch);
```

**Example**:
```c
char str[] = "Hello, World!";
char *result = strchr(str, 'W');  // Returns pointer to 'W' in "World"
```

## **8.5 Input and Output with Strings**

### **8.5.1 Reading a String**
- **`scanf()`** is commonly used to input strings.
  
**Syntax**:
```c
scanf("%s", str);
```

**Example**:
```c
char name[20];
scanf("%s", name);  // Reads a string (without spaces) into 'name'
```

**Important**:
- **`scanf()`** stops reading input at the first whitespace (space, tab, newline).

### **8.5.2 Reading a Line of Text**
- **`fgets()`** is safer for reading strings as it allows input with spaces.

**Syntax**:
```c
fgets(str, size, stdin);
```

**Example**:
```c
char sentence[50];
fgets(sentence, 50, stdin);  // Reads a whole line including spaces
```

- **Note**: `fgets()` stores the newline character (`\n`) when the user presses enter. It can be removed manually.

---

## **8.6 Multidimensional Character Arrays (2D Arrays)**
- A 2D character array is useful for storing a matrix of strings (like a list of names).
- Example:
  ```c
  char names[3][20] = {"John", "Alice", "Bob"};
  ```

### **Accessing 2D Array Elements**
```c
printf("%s", names[1]);  // Outputs "Alice"
```

### **Iterating Through a 2D Array of Strings**
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("%s\n", names[i]);  // Prints each name
}
```

## **8.7 String Literals and Pointers**
- In C, string literals like `"Hello"` are stored as arrays of characters.
- The name of a string is a **pointer to the first character** of the string.

**Example**:
```c
char *str = "Hello";  // str points to the first character of "Hello"
```

- You can manipulate strings using pointers, which is a more advanced but powerful approach.

## **8.8 Common String-Related Functions in `<string.h>`**
1. **`strlen()`**: Returns the length of the string (excluding the null character).
2. **`strcpy()`**: Copies one string to another.
3. **`strcat()`**: Concatenates two strings.
4. **`strcmp()`**: Compares two strings.
5. **`strchr()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
6. **`strstr()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string.
7. **`strtok()`**: Splits a string into tokens based on delimiters.

---

## **8.9 Summary**
- **Character arrays** in C are used to store strings, which are sequences of characters ending with a null character (`\0`).
- Common operations on strings include **copying**, **concatenating**, **comparing**, and **finding characters**.
- C provides several standard library functions in `<string.h>` for manipulating strings.
- Strings are terminated with `\0` and can be read using functions like `scanf()` or `fgets()`.
- Understanding string manipulation is essential for text processing in C.
