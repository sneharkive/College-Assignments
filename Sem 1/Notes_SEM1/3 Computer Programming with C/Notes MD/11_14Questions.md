## **Chapter 11: Pointers**

1. **Q: What are pointers in C?**  
   A: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.  
   Example:  
   ```c
   int x = 10;
   int *ptr = &x;  // ptr points to x.
   ```

2. **Q: What is the purpose of the `*` and `&` operators in pointers?**  
   A:  
   - `*` (dereference operator): Accesses the value at the memory address.  
   - `&` (address-of operator): Gets the address of a variable.

3. **Q: What are null pointers?**  
   A: A null pointer points to nothing and is initialized as `NULL` or `0`.  
   Example:  
   ```c
   int *ptr = NULL;
   ```

4. **Q: How do pointers improve efficiency in C?**  
   A: Pointers allow direct memory manipulation, reduce overhead for large data structures, and enable dynamic memory allocation.

5. **Q: What are function pointers?**  
   A: Pointers that point to functions and allow dynamic function calls.  
   Example:  
   ```c
   void (*fptr)() = myFunction;
   fptr();  // Calls myFunction.
   ```

6. **Q: What is pointer arithmetic?**  
   A: Arithmetic operations on pointers (e.g., `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`) to navigate through memory addresses.

7. **Q: How are pointers and arrays related?**  
   A: The array name acts as a pointer to its first element.  
   Example:  
   ```c
   int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
   int *ptr = arr;
   ```

## **Chapter 12: File Management in C**

8. **Q: What is file handling in C?**  
   A: File handling enables reading from and writing to files.

9. **Q: What are the modes of opening a file in C?**  
   A:  
   - `"r"`: Read.  
   - `"w"`: Write (overwrites existing content).  
   - `"a"`: Append.  
   - `"r+"`, `"w+"`, `"a+"`: Read/write.

10. **Q: What is the difference between text files and binary files?**  
    A:  
    - **Text files**: Store data in human-readable format.  
    - **Binary files**: Store data in machine-readable format.

11. **Q: How do you open and close a file in C?**  
    A:  
    - Open: `FILE *fp = fopen("filename", "mode");`  
    - Close: `fclose(fp);`

12. **Q: What are the common file I/O functions in C?**  
    A:  
    - `fgetc()`: Reads a character.  
    - `fputc()`: Writes a character.  
    - `fgets()`: Reads a string.  
    - `fputs()`: Writes a string.  
    - `fread()`, `fwrite()`: For binary files.

13. **Q: How do you check for end-of-file in C?**  
    A: Use the `feof()` function. Example:  
    ```c
    while (!feof(fp)) {
        // Read file.
    }
    ```

14. **Q: Explain random access in files.**  
    A: Functions like `fseek()` and `ftell()` allow jumping to specific file positions.

15. **Q: What is the significance of the `rewind()` function?**  
    A: Resets the file pointer to the beginning of the file.

## **Chapter 13: Dynamic Memory Allocation and Linked Lists**

16. **Q: What is dynamic memory allocation in C?**  
    A: Allocating memory at runtime using functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`.

17. **Q: How does `malloc()` differ from `calloc()`?**  
    A:  
    - `malloc()`: Allocates a block of memory without initializing it.  
    - `calloc()`: Allocates and initializes memory to zero.

18. **Q: Explain `realloc()` with an example.**  
    A: Resizes previously allocated memory.  
    Example:  
    ```c
    int *ptr = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    ptr = realloc(ptr, 10 * sizeof(int));
    ```

19. **Q: Why is the `free()` function important?**  
    A: Releases dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

20. **Q: What are linked lists?**  
    A: A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

21. **Q: How does a singly linked list differ from a doubly linked list?**  
    A:  
    - Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.  
    - Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.

22. **Q: How is a node created in a linked list?**  
    A:  
    ```c
    struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node *next;
    };
    ```

23. **Q: List operations performed on linked lists.**  
    A:  
    - Insertion.  
    - Deletion.  
    - Traversal.  
    - Searching.

## **Chapter 14: The Preprocessor**

24. **Q: What is the C preprocessor?**  
    A: A tool that processes code before compilation.

25. **Q: What are preprocessor directives?**  
    A: Commands that start with `#`, such as `#include`, `#define`, `#ifdef`.

26. **Q: What is the difference between `#include <file>` and `#include "file"`?**  
    A:  
    - `<file>`: Searches for the file in standard library paths.  
    - `"file"`: Searches in the current directory first, then in library paths.

27. **Q: What is a macro? How is it defined?**  
    A: A macro is a preprocessor substitution for a value or code block.  
    Example:  
    ```c
    #define PI 3.14
    ```

28. **Q: What are the advantages of macros?**  
    A:  
    - Faster than functions (no runtime overhead).  
    - Enables code reusability.

29. **Q: Explain conditional compilation with an example.**  
    A: Allows parts of code to be compiled based on conditions.  
    Example:  
    ```c
    #ifdef DEBUG
        printf("Debug mode");
    #endif
    ```

30. **Q: What is the purpose of `#undef`?**  
    A: It undefines a previously defined macro.  
    Example:  
    ```c
    #define MAX 100
    #undef MAX
    ```

31. **Q: What are file inclusion guards?**  
    A: Prevents multiple inclusions of the same header file using `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif`.

## **Miscellaneous Questions (Chapters 11â€“14)**

32. **Q: What is pointer-to-pointer in C?**  
    A: A pointer that stores the address of another pointer.  
    Example:  
    ```c
    int x = 10;
    int *p = &x;
    int **pp = &p;
    ```

33. **Q: What is memory fragmentation?**  
    A: Occurs when free memory is divided into non-contiguous blocks, making it hard to allocate large chunks.

34. **Q: How are circular linked lists different from singly linked lists?**  
    A: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node.

35. **Q: What is a sentinel node in a linked list?**  
    A: A dummy node used to simplify insertion and deletion operations.

36. **Q: What is the use of `ftell()`?**  
    A: Returns the current position of the file pointer.

37. **Q: How does `#pragma` work in C?**  
    A: A preprocessor directive for compiler-specific instructions.

38. **Q: What is the purpose of dynamic memory allocation in linked lists?**  
    A: Enables creating nodes at runtime based on user input or program requirements.

39. **Q: Can a pointer be initialized to any memory address?**  
    A: No, it should point to valid memory; otherwise, it causes undefined behavior.

40. **Q: What is a wildcard in file I/O?**  
    A: Symbols like `*` and `?` used to match file names in patterns.
