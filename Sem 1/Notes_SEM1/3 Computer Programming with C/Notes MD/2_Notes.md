# **Chapter 2: Constants, Variables, and Data Types**

## **2.1 Introduction**
- Every program manipulates data, and the C language provides mechanisms to classify and store this data.
- Constants, variables, and data types are foundational concepts essential for writing a C program.

---

## **2.2 Constants**
Constants are fixed values that cannot be altered during the program's execution.

### **Types of Constants**

1. **Integer Constants**  
   - Represent whole numbers.  
   - **Formats**: 
     - Decimal (e.g., `123`)
     - Octal (e.g., `077`)  
     - Hexadecimal (e.g., `0x1A`).

2. **Real Constants**  
   - Represent fractional numbers.  
   - Can be expressed in:  
     - Fixed-point notation (e.g., `12.34`)  
     - Exponential notation (e.g., `3.45e6`).

3. **Character Constants**  
   - A single character enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'A'`, `'9'`).  
   - Stored as ASCII values.

4. **String Constants**  
   - A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hello World"`).  
   - Includes an implicit null character `\0` at the end.

5. **Escape Sequences**  
   - Special characters preceded by a backslash.  
     | Escape Sequence | Meaning        |
     |-----------------|----------------|
     | `\n`            | New line       |
     | `\t`            | Tab            |
     | `\\`            | Backslash      |
     | `\'`            | Single quote   |
     | `\"`            | Double quote   |

## **2.3 Variables**
Variables are named memory locations that store data values.

### **Rules for Naming Variables**
1. Must begin with a letter or underscore (`_`).
2. Can include letters, digits, and underscores.
3. Cannot be a keyword.
4. Case-sensitive (e.g., `Num` and `num` are different).

### **Declaring Variables**
```c
int num;     // Declaration of an integer variable
float salary; // Declaration of a floating-point variable
char grade;  // Declaration of a character variable
```

### **Initializing Variables**
- Assigning a value to a variable at the time of declaration.
```c
int num = 10;
float salary = 5000.50;
char grade = 'A';
```

## **2.4 Data Types**
C provides a rich set of data types to represent different kinds of data.

### **Primary Data Types**
| Data Type   | Description                              | Example           |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `int`       | Integer type (whole numbers)             | `int age = 25;`   |
| `float`     | Single-precision floating-point numbers  | `float pi = 3.14;`|
| `double`    | Double-precision floating-point numbers  | `double pi = 3.14159;`|
| `char`      | Character type                          | `char grade = 'A';`|

### **Derived Data Types**
- Arrays, pointers, structures, and unions are built from primary types.

### **Enumeration Type**
- Used to define a set of named integer constants.
```c
enum color {red, green, blue};
enum color favorite = red;
```

### **Void Type**
- Used for functions that do not return a value.
```c
void display() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
}
```

---

## **2.5 Declaration of Variables**
Variables must be declared before they are used.

**Syntax**:
```c
data_type variable_name;
```

Example:
```c
int age;     // Declaration
age = 25;    // Assignment
```

---

## **2.6 Dynamic Initialization of Variables**
Variables can be initialized dynamically during program execution.
```c
int a = 10, b = 20;
int sum = a + b;  // Dynamic initialization
```

---

## **2.7 Constant Variables**
Variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be modified after initialization.
```c
const int MAX = 100;
MAX = 200;  // Error: MAX is a constant.
```

---

## **2.8 Data Type Modifiers**
Modifiers are used to alter the properties of data types like size and range.

### **Types of Modifiers**
- `signed`: Allows negative and positive values (default for integers).
- `unsigned`: Allows only non-negative values.
- `short`: Reduces the size of the variable.
- `long`: Increases the size of the variable.

**Examples**:
```c
unsigned int count = 100;  // No negative values allowed
long int population = 7000000;  // Larger range
```

---

## **2.9 Storage Classes**
Storage classes define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables.

| Storage Class   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `auto`          | Default for local variables; limited to the block.                         |
| `extern`        | Global variable accessible across multiple files.                          |
| `static`        | Retains its value between function calls.                                  |
| `register`      | Stored in a CPU register for faster access (if possible).                  |

**Example**:
```c
static int count = 0;  // Retains value between function calls
```

---

## **2.10 Type Casting**
Type casting is converting one data type to another.

### **Implicit Type Casting**
- Performed automatically by the compiler.
```c
int x = 10;
float y = x;  // Implicitly converted to float
```

### **Explicit Type Casting**
- Performed manually using cast operators.
```c
float x = 5.5;
int y = (int)x;  // Explicitly converted to int
```

---

## **2.11 Summary**
- Constants represent fixed values that do not change.
- Variables are used to store data values that may change during execution.
- Data types specify the kind of data a variable can hold.
- Proper use of constants, variables, and data types is essential for efficient programming.

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Always use meaningful names for variables.
2. Choose appropriate data types to optimize memory usage.
3. Understand the scope and lifetime of variables using storage classes.
